# Changes

## Unreleased

### Fixes

- Restore live subscriptions after WebSocket reconnects without replaying
  requests from a failed connection.
- Coalesce trailing database watcher events so burst writes do not leave the UI
  stale.
- Apply a default timeout to `bd` commands so one hung process cannot block all
  lists, details, and mutations indefinitely.
- Apply list-row edits optimistically, roll them back on failure, and show an
  actionable error instead of silently discarding the change.
- Persist multi-select status and issue-type filters across reloads and keep the
  server-computed Ready filter mutually exclusive.
- Restore the saved workspace before creating initial subscriptions and refresh
  the Board's Closed today window at midnight or when the page becomes visible.
- Prevent stale workspace, cache, and subscription results from being published
  after lifecycle changes.
- Run detail, comment, dependency, label, delete, and mutation commands against
  the currently selected workspace instead of the daemon's startup directory.
- Recover malformed subscription deltas with a fresh snapshot instead of
  silently accepting later updates on stale state.
- Replace blocking subscription-failure dialogs with scoped, retryable alerts
  that preserve successfully loaded Issues, Epics, detail, and Board content.

### Enhancements

- Refresh the interface with an OpenShift-style masthead, surfaces, controls,
  badges, focus states, and coordinated light and dark color palettes.
- Open issue details immediately from active list or Board data while the full
  detail and comments load in the background, with an inline retry when comments
  fail.
- Add Today, 3 days, and 7 days filters to the Board's Closed column.
- Expand issue search to include IDs, titles, assignees, and labels.
- Add stable, accessible sorting to every Issues column and to Priority and
  Updated in the Epics table.
- Improve empty states with Create Issue and Clear Filters actions.
- Render comments as sanitized Markdown with readable relative timestamps.
- Improve keyboard editing focus and add accessible names, selection state, and
  sorting metadata to issue tables.
- Add discoverable keyboard-shortcut help and slash-to-focus Issues search.
- Show priorities consistently as rounded, color-coded badges with emoji,
  P-number, and label values.
- Render large Issues results progressively in 200-row segments while applying
  search, filters, and sorting to the complete loaded result first.
- Print the reusable server URL after `bdui start` or `bdui restart` connects to
  an already running server.

### Performance

- Coalesce subscription-store notifications and defer sorting so synchronous
  update bursts trigger one sort and render cycle.
- Scope store notifications to the affected view, debounce issue search, key
  issue rows and Board cards by ID, and avoid redundant persisted state writes.
- Prewarm Board lists, reuse in-flight and refresh results, and keep bounded,
  generation-safe detail, comment, and sanitized Markdown caches.
- Prioritize interactive detail and mutation commands in the serialized `bd`
  queue while retaining bounded service for background refreshes.
- Coalesce list refresh bursts and mutation-triggered refresh work.
- Add capability-gated atomic server delta delivery while preserving legacy
  snapshot, upsert, and delete compatibility.
- Bound list snapshots to 1,000 issues with exact truncation metadata, connection
  quotas, and WebSocket frame and buffer limits.
- Remove redundant `bd show` processes after supported field updates by using
  canonical `bd update --json` replies with an older-CLI fallback.
- Cache comment author lookups per workspace and remove obsolete client
  membership state now owned by full-issue subscription stores.
- Add deterministic 1,000/5,000/10,000 issue benchmark tooling and retain the
  1,000-item production ceiling until real-browser and representative `bd`
  evidence satisfies the larger-tier gates.

### Security

- Remove the raw-HTML issue title sink and accumulated event listeners from the
  delete confirmation dialog.
- Strictly validate subscription IDs, capabilities, types, and parameters, and
  reject client-controlled result limits.
